	A simple set of php scripts that should take some of the pain
	out of developing in PHP, each file states it's dependencies 
	if it has any in the comment at the top of the file.
	
	error.func.inc.php
		
		- custom_error($msg)
			This is the same as trigger_error() except that it will
			shown the file info from the locatin where the function
			it is used in is called, not the line trigger_error() is
			called.
	
	file.class.inc.php
		
		- file::get_mime($path)
			Gets the mime type of the given file using the best 
			method available, with a fall-back to using the file
			extension.
		
		- file::rmrf($path)
			Recursively deleted all of the files in the given folder
			and then removes that folder.
	
	http.class.inc.php
		
		- http::post($url, $data, $return = true)
			Sends HTTP POST data to the given url, $data should be
			an array where the keys represent the form names and the
			values represent the values. The $return parameter
			can be set to false if the result is not needed.
		
		- http::get($url, $data = null, $return = true)
			Effectively the same as above, but using GET. The $data
			parameter is now optional also.
		
		- http::force_download($path)
			Sends the headers needed to force the download of the
			given file, then reads out the file.
		
		- http::force_download_raw($name, $size, $data)
			Does the same task as above but takes data directly,
			not from a file. $name is the name of the file that
			should be shown in the download window, $size is the 
			files size and $data is the raw data.
	
	mail.class.inc.php
		
		Unfinished, see source.
	
	string.func.inc.php
		
		- str_starts_with($needle, $haystack)
			Returns true if $haystack starts with $needle, false if
			not
		
		- str_ends_with($needle, $haystack)
			Returns true if $haystack ends with $needle, false if not
		
		- str_contains($needle, $haystack)
			Returns true if $haystack contains one or more occurrences
